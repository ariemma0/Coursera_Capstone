Introduction:

	In the Project I will use FourSquare location data from existing
Ice Cream Shop locations.  I will explore the neighborhoods surrounding
each shop to determine the types of venues that support foot traffic for 
Ice Cream Shops.  I will then create a Regression Model to evaluate 
new locations.

Business Problem:

	An Ice Cream Shop wants to expand and open a new location 
somewhere in Manhattan.  I will use FourSquare’s location data to 
create features for Machine Learning Regression to evaluate available 
retail space.
