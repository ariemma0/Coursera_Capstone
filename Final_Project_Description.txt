Introduction:

	This Project is the capstone to Applied Data Science on Coursera
completing certification in Date Science from IBM.  In the project, we
have been by contracted by XYZ ice Cream Co. to examine available retail
locations in Manhattan and produce a report indicating the 10 best
locations to open a new XYZ Ice Cream shop.

Business Problem:

	XYZ Ice Cream Shop wants to expand and open a new location
somewhere in Manhattan. Finding a good location is key in the retail
business. Choosing a poor location will waste extensive funds required
during re-modeling and start-up of the new business.  XYZ wants to make
sure a good location is chosen before construction begins.
