Data:

	I will use several resources for my information.  I will start with
FourSquare’s Seach API to find all the Ice Cream Shops in Manhattan.  I
Will then use FourSquare’s Explore API to find all the types of venues
that surround existing Ice Cream Shops.  I will use this data to create a 
regression model to evaluate new locations.  I will then use a screen 
scrapper to extract available retail space in Manhattan.   I will then 
use FourSquare Explore API to find all the venues that surround the 
available locations.  Lastly I will run all the available location data 
through my Regression model to produce a report with the Locations
that received the highest score.
