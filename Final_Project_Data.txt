Data:

	Several resources will be used as the data to solve XYZ’s problem.
First, FourSquare’s Seach API will be used to find all the Ice Cream
shops currently operating in Manhattan.  The locations of the ice cream
shop will be used by FourSquare’s Explore API to find all the types of
venues that surround existing Ice Cream Shops.  The surrounding venues
data will be used as the feature attribute set to create a regression
model to evaluate new locations.  Available retail space will be found
by using a screen scrapper against the real estate web site showcase.com.
For each available location we will find the surrounding venues by using
FourSquare Explore API again. Lastly we will run all the available
location data through my Regression model to produce a report with the
best locations that received the highest score.
